# Safety Compliance in Work Environments
## An Image and Facial Detection System Using Machine Learning

### Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the MSc Dissertation titled "Safety Compliance in Work Environments: An Image and Facial Detection System Using Machine Learning." The project aims to enhance workplace safety by using machine learning algorithms for real-time monitoring and compliance checking. The study focuses on two main aspects: detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) using YOLOv8 and facial recognition using DeepFace models.

### Installation

[code]
[code]git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
cd yourrepositoryname
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline includes several steps like data splitting, encoding, noise reduction, image resizing, and more. For a detailed description, please refer to the [Data Preprocessing Document](link-to-document).

### Data Sources

- **Roboflow**: Provides a comprehensive platform for computer vision that offers a wide range of free public datasets in multiple formats. It allows for easy upload, organization, labeling, augmentation, and processing of datasets. More about Roboflow can be found [here](https://roboflow.com/).

- **Bluewillow**: A free AI image generator tool that produces photo-realistic scenes. It employs various AI image generation models including stable diffusion and Dall-E1. Learn more about Bluewillow [here](#).

### YOLOv8 for PPE Detection

The YOLOv8 model is trained on a custom dataset to identify PPE kits such as helmets, safety vests, gloves, and boots. For more details, check the [YOLOv8 Documentation](link-to-document).

### Facial Recognition using DeepFace

The DeepFace model is used to recognize workers and allow or deny access to the work environment. For implementation details, see the [DeepFace Documentation](link-to-document).

### Usage

Provide a step-by-step guide on how to run the code, including example command lines for training and inference.
